   <br/>
I'm not afraid to take a stand<br/>
Everybody come take my hand I guessI'm not afraid to take a stand<br/>
Everybody come take my hand I guess<br/>
We'll walk this road together' through the storm<br/>
Whatever weather' cold or warm<br/>
Just let you know that' you're not alone<br/>
Hola if you feel that you've been down the same road<br/>
You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em<br/>
But you won't take this thing out these words before I say 'em<br/>
Cause ain't no way I'm let you stop me from causing mayhem<br/>
When I say 'em or do something I do it' I don't give a damn<br/>
What you think' I'm doing this for me' so fuck the world<br/>
Feed it beans' it's gassed up' if a thing's stopping me<br/>
I'mma be what I set out to be' without a doubt undoubtedly<br/>
And all those who look down on me I'm tearing down your balcony<br/>
No if ands or buts don't try to ask him why or how can he<br/>
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album he's still shit and<br/>
Whether he's on salary' paid hourly<br/>
Until he bows out or he shit's his bowels out of him<br/>
Whichever comes first' for better or worse<br/>
He's married to the game' like a fuck you for christmas<br/>
His gift is a curse' forget the earth he's got the urge<br/>
To pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the universe<br/>
I'm not afraid to take a stand<br/>
Everybody come take my hand<br/>
We'll walk this road together' through the storm<br/>
Whatever weather' cold or warm<br/>
Just let you know that' you're not alone<br/>
Holla if you feel that you've been down the same road<br/>
Ok quit playin' with the scissors and shit' and cut the crap<br/>
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know it's a rap<br/>
You said you was king' you lied through your teeth<br/>
For that fuck your feelings' instead of getting crowned you're getting capped<br/>
And to the fans' I'll never let you down again' I'm back<br/>
I promise to never go back on that promise' in fact<br/>
Let's be honest' that last Relapse CD was "ehhhh"<br/>
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground<br/>
Relax' I ain't going back to that now<br/>
All I'm tryna say is get back' click-clack BLAOW<br/>
Cause I ain't playin' around<br/>
There's a game called circle and I don't know how<br/>
I'm way too up to back down<br/>
But I think I'm still tryna figure this crap out<br/>
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't<br/>
This fucking black cloud's still follow's me around<br/>
But it's time to exercise these demons<br/>
These motherfuckers are doing jumping jacks now!<br/>
I'm not afraid to take a stand<br/>
Everybody come take my hand<br/>
We'll walk this road together' through the storm<br/>
Whatever weather' cold or warm<br/>
Just let you know that' you're not alone<br/>
Holla if you feel that you've been down the same road<br/>
And I just can't keep living this way<br/>
So starting today' I'm breaking out of this cage<br/>
I'm standing up' Imma face my demons<br/>
I'm manning up' Imma hold my ground<br/>
I've had enough' now I'm so fed up<br/>
Time to put my life back together right now<br/>
It was my decision to get clean' I did it for me<br/>
Admittedly i probably did it subliminally for you<br/>
So I could come back a brand new me' you helped see me through<br/>
And don't even realise what you did' believe me you<br/>
I been through the ringer' but they can do little to the middle finger<br/>
I think I got a tear in my eye' I feel like the king of<br/>
My world' haters can make like bees with no stingers' and drop dead<br/>
No more beef flingers' no more drama from now on' I promise<br/>
To focus soley on handling my responsibility's as a father<br/>
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it<br/>
You couldn't lift a single shingle lonely<br/>
Cause the way I feel' I'm strong enough to go to the club<br/>
Put a ??? and lift the whole liquor counter up<br/>
Cause I'm raising the bar' I shoot for the moon<br/>
But I'm too busy gazing at stars' I feel amazing and<br/>
I'm not afraid to take a stand<br/>
Everybody come take my hand<br/>
We'll walk this road together' through the storm<br/>
Whatever weather' cold or warmv
Just let you know that' you're not alone<br/>
Holla if you feel that you've been down the same road<br/>
