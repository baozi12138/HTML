   <br/>
   Yeah<br/>
　　I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now<br/>
　　But hey, what'd daddy always tell you?<br/>
　　Straighten up little soldier<br/>
　　Stiffen up that upper lip<br/>
　　Whatchu crying about?<br/>
　　You got me.<br/>
　　Hailie, I know you miss your mom<br/>
　　And I know you miss your dad when I'm gone<br/>
　　But I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had<br/>
　　I can see your sad<br/>
　　Even when you smile<br/>
　　Even when you laugh<br/>
　　I can see it in your eyes<br/>
　　Deep inside you wanna cry<br/>
　　Cuz you're scared<br/>
　　I ain't there,<br/>
　　Daddy's with you in your prayers<br/>
　　No more cryin'<br/>
　　Wipe them tears<br/>
　　Daddy's here<br/>
　　No more nightmares<br/>
　　We gonna pull together through it<br/>
　　We gon' do it<br/>
　　Lainie's uncle's crazy ain't he, yeah<br/>
　　But he loves you girl and you better know it<br/>
　　We're all we got in this world<br/>
　　When it spins<br/>
　　When it swirls<br/>
　　When it whirls<br/>
　　When it twirls<br/>
　　Two little beautiful girls<br/>
　　Lookin' puzzled, in a daze<br/>
　　I know it's confusing you<br/>
　　Daddy's always on the move<br/>
　　Mama's always on the news<br/>
　　I try to keep you sheltered from it<br/>
　　But somehow it seems, the harder that I try to do that<br/>
　　The more it backfires on me<br/>
　　All the things, growin' up<br/>
　　As daddy, daddy had to see<br/>
　　Daddy don't want you to see<br/>
　　But you see just as much as he did<br/>
　　We did not plan it to be this way,<br/>
　　Your mother and me<br/>
　　But things have got so bad between us<br/>
　　I don't see us ever being<br/>
　　Together ever again<br/>
　　Like we used to be like when we was teenagers<br/>
　　But then of course<br/>
　　Everything always happen for a reason<br/>
　　I guess it was never meant to be<br/>
　　But it's just something<br/>
　　We have no control over<br/>
　　And that's what destiny is<br/>
　　But no more worries<br/>
　　Rest your head and go to sleep<br/>
　　Maybe one day we'll wake up<br/>
　　And this will all just be a dream<br/>
　　Now hush little baby don't you cry<br/>
　　Every thing's gonna be all right<br/>
　　Stiffin' that upper lip up little lady I told ya<br/>
　　Daddy's here to hold ya through the night<br/>
　　I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why<br/>
　　We fear how we feel inside, it may seem a little crazy<br/>
　　Pretty baby but I promise, Mama's gon' be alright<br/>
　　It's funny,<br/>
　　I remember back one year when daddy had no money<br/>
　　Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up<br/>
　　And stuck 'em under the tree<br/>
　　And said some of 'em were from me<br/>
　　Cuz daddy couldn't buy 'em<br/>
　　I'll never forget that Christmas<br/>
　　I sat up the whole night crying<br/>
　　Cuz daddy felt like a bum<br/>
　　See daddy had a job, but his job<br/>
　　Was to keep the food on the table for you and mom<br/>
　　And at the time every house that we lived in<br/>
　　Either kept getting broken into and robbed or shot up on the block<br/>
　　And your mom, was saving money for you in a jar<br/>
　　Tryna to start a piggy bank for you<br/>
　　So you could go to college<br/>
　　Almost had a thousand dollars<br/>
　　'Till someone broke in and stole it<br/>
　　And I know it hurt so bad it broke your mamma's heart<br/>
　　And it seemed like everything was just starting to fall apart<br/>
　　Mom and dad was arguing a lot<br/>
　　So mama moved back on to Chalmers in a flat<br/>
　　One bedroom apartment<br/>
　　And dad moved back to the other side of 8 mile on Novara<br/>
　　And that's when daddy went to California with his cd<br/>
　　And met Dr. Dre and flew you and Mama out to see me,<br/>
　　But daddy had to work, you and mama had to leave me,<br/>
　　Then you started seeing daddy on the tv<br/>
　　And mama didn't like it<br/>
　　And you and Lainnie were too young to understand it<br/>
　　Papa was a rollin' stone, mama developed a habit<br/>
　　And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it<br/>
　　I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it firsthand<br/>
　　Cuz all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud<br/>
　　Now I'm sittin' in this empty house,<br/>
　　Just reminiscing. Looking at your baby pictures it just tricks me out<br/>
　　To see how much you both have grown it's almost like you're sisters now<br/>
　　Wow, guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here<br/>
　　Lainnie I'm talking to you too daddy's still here<br/>
　　I like the sound of that, yeahv
　　It's got a ring to it don't it<br/>
　　Shhh, mama's only gone for the moment<br/>
　　Now hush little baby don't you cry<br/>
　　Every thing's gonna be all right<br/>
　　Stiffin' that upper lip up little lady I told ya<br/>
　　Daddy's here to hold ya through the night<br/>
　　I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why<br/>
　　We fear how we feel inside, it may seem a little crazy<br/>
　　Pretty baby but I promise, mama's gon' be alright<br/>
　　And if you ask me to, daddy's gonna buy you a mocking bird<br/>
　　I'ma give you the world, I'ma buy a diamond ring for you,<br/>
　　I'ma sing for you, I'll do anything for you to see you smile<br/>
　　And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine<br/>
　　I'ma break that birdie's neck, I'll go back to the jeweler<br/>
　　Who sold it to ya<br/>
　　And make him eat every carat<br/>
　　Don't fuck with Dad (ha ha)<br/>
   The End<br/>
